excerpt: "Using the any type in TypeScript tests can lead to less maintainable and error-prone code. Let's explore how to avoid it and improve our test quality."
---

When we use `any` in TypeScript, we are telling the compiler to opt out of type checking. Going back to using plain JavaScript.
This is defeating the purpose of using TypeScript in the first place.

I totally sided with this approach, but I was open to the idea of using `any` in tests. It's not production code after all
and the tests are focused only on the data required to run the tests, not the actual types.

There is a better way to handle this, and it is to use data fixtures.

## Creating data fixtures

The simplest way to create data fixtures is to hand craft them using factory functions and partial building.
This is a great way to ensure that the data is valid and meets the requirements of the tests without having to use `any`.

Let's take a look at an example:

```typescript
type User = {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	email: string;
};

function createUser(overrides: Partial<User> = {}): User {
	return {
		id: 'default-id',
		name: 'Default Name',
		email: 'default@example.com',
		...overrides
	};
}
```

This function allows us to create a `User` object with default values, while also allowing us to override any of the properties we want.

When it comes to testing, we may be interested in only a few of the properties because
the production code is operating on a subset of the data. This is where we can use pass the overrides:

```typescript
const user = createUser({ name: 'John Doe', email: 'john.doe@example.com' });
```

This would still yield a valid user object with the default `id` but with the overridden `name` and `email` properties.
Given all the AI tooling available today, you can generate these factory functions quickly and easily.

## Using faker

This is fairly static data but we can make it a bit more interesting by using the `faker` library to generate random data.

```typescript
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';
type User = {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	email: string;
};
function createUser(overrides: Partial<User> = {}): User {
	return {
		id: faker.string.uuid(),
		name: faker.person.fullName(),
		email: faker.internet.email(),
		...overrides
	};
}
```

This could test the robustness of the code against a wider range of data, while still ensuring that the data
is valid and meets the requirements of the tests. It could result in non-deterministic tests, but that is a trade-off
worth considering.

### Using zod-mock

[Zod](https://zod.dev/) has become a standard library for schema validation in Typescript. Many developers use it
to define their data structures and infer types from them. A library that could be paired with this is
[zod-mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anatine/zod-mock), which can generate mock data based on Zod schemas.

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { mock } from '@anatine/zod-mock';

type User = z.infer<typeof userSchema>;

const userSchema = z.object({
	id: z.string().uuid(),
	name: z.string(),
	email: z.string().email()
});

function createUser(overrides: Partial<User> = {}): User {
	const user = mock(userSchema);
	return { ...user, ...overrides };
}
```

This approach allows you to define your data structure using Zod and then generate mock data based on that schema.
It combines the benefits of type safety and ease of use, making it a powerful tool for testing.

## Conclusion

After reading this, there are not many excuses to continoue using `any` in your TypeScript tests.

Looking at that last example above, there is not a lot of boilerplate code to create a data fixture. So stop using `any`
and start using data fixtures to create valid test data. This will help you write better tests, catch more bugs, and
improve the overall quality of your codebase.

Happy testing! üßë‚Äçüíª
