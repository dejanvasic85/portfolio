excerpt: 'A basic CLAUDE.md file can go a long way in improving your Svelte project.'

Today we have a plethora of AI tools at our disposal from Anthropic like [MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)
and [Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills). But let's not forget the classic approach of providing clear instructions
to the model through a `CLAUDE.md` file which takes time to refine and get right. In fact, it probably needs to be keep
changing as the project evolves! So here I'd like to share what I'm using if it's helpful to anyone building Svelte applications.

Have fun building with Svelte and Claude! ðŸš€ ðŸ‘‹

# Technical Requirements

- Svelte Kit v2 and Svelte v5
- Tailwind CSS V4
- Accessibility (a11y) AA compliant
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Clean and maintainable code with re-usable Svelte components

Please read all the latest documentation for (Svelte Kit)[svelte.dev/llms.txt] and Tailwind CSS to ensure you are familiar with the latest features and best practices before implementing any new features or changes in these areas.

# Code style

- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')
- Each Svelte component should declare its own prop types using TypeScript within the same file
- Svelte component files should have constants declared outside the component function
- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Use PascalCase for Svelte components
- Avoid use of inline styles, prefer Tailwind CSS classes
- Avoid using `any` type in Typescript or casting with as
- Declare constant values and objects using `const`
- Constant values that are objects, do not use CAPS for the variable name, use camelCase instead suffixed with 'Value'
- Event handlers should be named with the `handle` prefix (e.g. `handleClick`)
- Only write code comments when the code is not clear and keep it conscise, avoid commenting out code
- Avoid magic numbers and strings, use constants instead
- Each file should have line break at the end
- Try to limit components and modules up to 200 lines and split in to different components to manage complexity
- Typescript files should be camelCase e.g. myService.ts

# Workflow

- Be sure to run `npm run check` when you're done making a series of code changes
- Use `npm run format` whenever the format is not correct
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance

# Dependency management

- Ensure to find the latest version of a package before adding it
- Avoid using deprecated packages or APIs
```
