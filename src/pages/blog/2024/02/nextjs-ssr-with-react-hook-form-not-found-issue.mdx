excerpt: "A deep dive into the 'Form Not Found' issue in Next.js applications using React Hook Form, and how to resolve it effectively."
---

Recently, our Next.js application started reporting that a handful of users were experiencing a 'Not Found'
error after submitting a form. Upon reviewing session replays, it became clear that users were encountering a
404 error immediately after form submission, despite the page and form being fully rendered.

## The problem

In our setup, we used [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) within a client-side component to
submit forms to an API endpoint.

When a user initially loads the HTML page, the form is visible, but the JavaScript `onSubmit` handler is absent
until the Next.js page chunk fully loads. If a user submits the form before the handler is ready, the form defaults
to a GET action, appending the selected value as a URL parameter e.g. `/form-url?australianCitizen=yes`,
leading to a 404 since that endpoint does not exist.

## **Solution 1: Disabling the Submit Button**

To address this, we decided to prevent form submission until the JavaScript was fully loaded.
This was achieved by disabling the submit button initially and then enabling it using the `useEffect` hook.
The only way the button could be enabled is when the JavaScript was fully loaded!

Full code sample:

```JSX
'use client';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export const CitizenForm = () => {
  const [isEnabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);
  const form = useForm();

  useEffect(() => {
    setEnabled(true);
  }, []);

  const onSubmit = (data) => {
    fetch('/api/citizenship', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(data),
    });
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      ...
      <button type="submit" disabled={!isEnabled}>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

## **Solution 2: Leveraging Server Actions**

Another potential solution, which I hadn't explored at the time, involves utilizing
server actions in Next.js. This approach allows for form submissions without relying
on client-side JavaScript, offering a more streamlined and elegant solution.

## Conclusion

Addressing the 'Form Not Found' issue in Next.js applications can be challenging but is crucial for maintaining a seamless user experience. By either disabling the submit button until the JavaScript loads or utilizing server actions, developers can ensure reliable form submissions in their applications.
