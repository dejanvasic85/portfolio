excerpt: 'Handling token expiry with Auth0 and Apollo GraphQL'
---

Seems like there is an abundance of articles out there to wire up [Auth0 SPA](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0-single-page-app-sdk)
library to a react with Apollo GraphQL application but none of them seem to explain how to handle the token expiry scenario
(not easily anyway).
Majority of the articles I found firstly didn't involve Auth0 and secondly they are based on 401 responses from a server in
the GraphQL [ErrorLink](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/link/apollo-link-error/) middleware followed
by a [complex fromPromise](https://able.bio/AnasT/apollo-graphql-async-access-token-refresh--470t1c8) calls
to obtain a new token and then retry the original calls.

After a few attempts at this pattern, I had no luck. So I decided to change the strategy from handling 401 server responses,
to instead check the expiry date on the token, so if expired call `getTokenSilently` to get a new token. Simple.

#### Basic setup

This youtube video is a really good example to follow along to setup the basic auth0 react Provider. It leaves you with only having to figure out which configuration values to apply in your application.

## Backend

The tech stack used here as an example uses a [Koa](https://koajs.com/) server with a route `/api/graphql`
that is requires an auth token. The middleware auth can be applied now by using the `koa-jwt` package along with the `jwks-rsa` package.
The youtube video above provides a walkthrough on setting up authorization on graphQL operations. This does definitely make it more flexible.

Looking at the middleware code:

```typescript
import { Context, Next } from 'koa';
import jwt from 'koa-jwt';
import jwtrsa from 'jwks-rsa';

export default function ({ auth: { domain, audience } }) {
	return jwt({
		secret: jwtrsa.koaJwtSecret({
			jwksUri: `https://${domain}/.well-known/jwks.json`,
			cache: true,
			cacheMaxEntries: 5
		}),
		audience: audience,
		issuer: `https://${domain}/`,
		algorithms: ['RS256']
	}).unless({ path: [/^\/api\/(playground)/] });
}
```

You may notice that the Playground path is excluded. Now, in the koa app setup we just add the required middleware:

```typescript
import Koa from 'koa';
import config from './config';
import authMiddleware from './authMiddleware';
import { graphQLServer, graphQLPlayground } from './graphql';

const app = new Koa();
app.use(mount('/api', authMiddleware(config)));

// setup
graphQLServer.applyMiddleware({ app, path: '/api/graphql' });
graphQLPlayground.applyMiddleware({ app, path: '/api/playground' });

// start it up
app.listen(4000);
```

## Frontend

The grunt of the work to handle this situation happens in the Apollo graphQL client middleware.
But I'll start providing the code examples from the GraphQL provider:

```typescript
import createClient from './createClient';

const GraphQLProvider = ({ children }: Props) => {
  const auth = useAuth()!;

  const { getTokenSilently } = auth;

  const client = createClient({ getTokenSilently});

  return <ApolloProvider client={client}>{children}</ApolloProvider>;
};

export default GraphQLProvider;
```

The `createClient` method returns a new GraphQL client. The key part of this snippet is the
order in which the links are created. The auth0Link comes first and is responsible to always
ensure that there is a valid token. The authLink is only responsible for attaching the token in to the http headers.

```typescript
export default function createClient({ getTokenSilently }) {
  const auth0Link = createAuth0Link({ getTokenSilently });
  const errorLink = ...;
  const webSocketLink = ...;

  const splitLink = split(
    ({ query }) => {
      const definition = getMainDefinition(query);
      return definition.kind === 'OperationDefinition' && definition.operation === 'subscription';
    },
    webSocketLink,
    httpLink,
  );

  const authLink = setContext((_, { headers, auth0Token }) => ({
    headers: {
      ...headers,
      ...(auth0Token ? { Authorization: `Bearer ${auth0Token}` } : {}),
    },
  }));

  const link = from([auth0Link, errorLink, authLink, splitLink]);
  const cache = createInMemoryCache();
  const apolloClient = new ApolloClient<NormalizedCacheObject>({
    link,
    cache,
  });

  return apolloClient;
}

```

So let's have a look at the auth0Link:

```typescript
import jwtDecode, { JwtPayload } from 'jwt-decode';

let cachedToken: string;
let tokenExpiry: Date;

export const getAuthToken = async ({ getTokenSilently }) => {
	if (cachedToken && tokenExpiry > new Date()) {
		return cachedToken;
	}

	console.log('Requesting new token. Old one expired');
	const newToken = await getTokenSilently();
	cachedToken = newToken;
	const { exp } = jwtDecode<JwtPayload>(newToken);
	tokenExpiry = new Date(exp * 1000);
	return cachedToken;
};
```

As mentioned at the start of this post, the `getTokenSilently` is the method we 
need to invoke from Auth0 to get a new jwt token. But we only want to get a new 
one if the cached one has expired. And this is quite simple by using the jwt-decode 
library and storing the token expiry date when we receive a new one.

Happy coding with Apollo GraphQL...
