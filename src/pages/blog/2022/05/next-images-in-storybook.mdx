excerpt: 'Displaying Nextjs Image component in Storybook'
---

The [Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) component is very much a key
selling point for the Next framework. This is a must use for performance and user experience
but a situation inevitably arises to use it in a custom component that we'd like to test
out in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org). Doing this produces the following error.

> Invalid src prop xxx on next/image hostname xxx is not configured under images in your next.config.js

When I ran to this problem initially, [I found the original solution worked a treat](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64765638/971085). However, after a Nextjs [12.1.5](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.1.5) release, the issue came back and the original workaround lost the battle.

To simply remove this error in storybook, we just need to apply the \`unoptimized\` prop to the \`next/image\` component and voila! Storybook is back and working again.

But this isn't how we want roll in production so we need to find a way to apply this prop
to be false only in production code. A strategy I found useful here to use is the React Context.
So we begin by creating the Provider and Context which has the `unoptimized` prop and set to false by default.

```typescript
import React from 'react';

interface ImageOptions {
  unoptimized: boolean;
}

interface ProviderProps extends ImageOptions {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export const ImageOptimisationContext = React.createContext<ImageOptions>({ unoptimized: false });

// This provider is useful for allowing storybook to use a unoptimized: true
export const ImageOptimisationProvider = ({ children, unoptimized }: ProviderProps) => {
  return <ImageOptimisationContext.Provider value={{ unoptimized }}>{children}</ImageOptimisationContext.Provider>;
};

```

The new custom wrapper Image component gets access to the React context and applies this property along with the rest of the
`next/image` component. And is very similar to the solution applied previously.

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import NextImage, { ImageProps } from 'next/image';

import { ImageOptimisationContext } from '@providers';

const Image = (props: ImageProps) => {
  const { unoptimized } = React.useContext(ImageOptimisationContext);
  return <NextImage {...props} unoptimized={unoptimized} />;
};

export default Image;
```

Wherever we use the next/image component, we replace it with our custom Image.
Whip that find and replace if you like to live on the edge.

```typescript
// From
import Image from 'next/image`;

// To
import Image from './components'
```

### The final touch

[A global storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/decorators#global-decorators)
decorator would flip the prop to true and we should once again be rid of this issue, or at least for now.

Here's the final `./storybook/preview.js`:

```typescript
import React from 'react';

import { ImageOptimisationProvider } from '../src/providers';

export const decorators = [
  (Story) => (
    <ImageOptimisationProvider unoptimized={true}>
      <Story />
    </ImageOptimisationProvider>
  ),
];
```

Happy story booking...
