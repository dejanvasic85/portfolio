excerpt: 'Implementing a unit of work pattern for atomic transactions in Node.js with TypeScript and MSSQL.'
---

Recently I had the opportunity to rewrite a microservice responsible for writing records to
two different databases in a single atomic transaction. The service is written in Typescript
and deployed in a lambda using the [serverless framework](http://serverless.com).

With my old .Net hat back, transactions were easily achieved with a transaction
scope or the Entity Framework's Db Context. Yes, there were still some patterns required.

Coming across the [mssql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql) node package, it seemed to
do the trick for all the simple SQL statements. This code would live in a repository that
exposes a few create methods. So let's say we have this in some business processing layer where
two records need to be inserted but should be accomplished with a single database transaction:

```typescript
import repository from './repository';

export const addUser = async (name, email, password) => {
	await repository.createProfile(name, email);
	await repository.createLogin(email, password);
};
```

If the `createLogin` method fails, then the `createProfile` method should roll back successfully.

Given a simple unit of work pattern, I wanted to simply surround these two methods so it looks like the following:

```typescript
const unitOfWork = withUnitOfWork(repository);
await repository.createProfile(name, email);
await repository.createLogin(email, password);
await unitOfWork.commit();
```

That type of syntax would be ideal because it is testable in my opinion. What if multiple repositories needed to be called like this?

```typescript
import userRepository from './userRepository';
import authRepository from './authRepository';
import withUnitOfWork from './unitOfWork';

export const addUser = async (name, email, password) => {
  const unitOfWork = withUnitOfWork(userRepository, authRepository);
  await userRepository.createProfile(name, email);
  await authRepository.createLogin(email, password);
  unitOfWork.commit();
}
```

Yes, that would also be a valuable requirement here. Generally a business method would span multiple repositories.

Firstly, using typescript each repository needs to have a `beginTransaction` method.

```typescript
export interface Repository {
  beginTransaction: () => Promise<Transaction>;
}
```

Then, the unit of work should be as simple as:

```typescript
import { Repository, UnitOfWork } from './types';
import { Transaction } from 'mssql';
import logger from './logger';

const withUnitOfWork = async (...repositories: Repository[]): Promise<UnitOfWork> => {
  const transactions: Transaction[] = await Promise.all(repositories.map(async r => await r.beginTransaction()));

  return {
    commit: async (): Promise<void> => {
      try {
        logger.info(`Commiting transactions [${transactions.length}]`);
        for (const { commit } of transactions) {
          await commit();
        }
      } catch (err) {
        logger.error(`An error occurred in SQL Transaction`, err);
        for (const { rollback } of transactions) {
          rollback();
        }
      }
    }
  };
};

export default withUnitOfWork;
```

So what's happening here is very simple. Each repository has a beginTransaction method which will connect to the 
required database and start a transaction then return it to the unit of work. On commit, each transaction's
`commit` is called.

Should there be any errors thrown, all the transactions will be rolled back.

Happy coding with transactions in Node.js and Typescript.
