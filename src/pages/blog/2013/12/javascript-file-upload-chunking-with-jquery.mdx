I'm currently working on a single page application that is hosted in a windows form application using the
.Net browser control. Pretty interesting stuff given that the windows application exposes an "API"
full of JavaScript handlers to hook on.

TL/DR: Here's the full fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/dejanvasic/9ahU8/ (don't click start because the
fiddle post wasn't hooked on properly)

Explanation:

The purpose of the file manager is to be able to receive the file data in fluent way and report back
to the UI about the progress once "uploadFiles" method is called:

```javascript
var manager = new FileManager(128)
	.addFile('1', 'Kd93kjf93ll')
	.addFile('2', 'kLKdn2201Akjk')
	.uploadFiles(progressHandler);
```

Using bootstrap for css framework, the progressHandler can simply adjust accordingly:

```javascript
function progressHandler(data) {
	$('.bar').width(data.TotalProgress + '%');
}
```

Given the server side is using ASP.Net MVC action method, the chunks have to come in order so that it can be
simply appended to a file stream:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public JsonResult UploadFileChunk(string id, string data, int currentPosition)
{
    if (id.IsNullOrEmpty() || data.IsNullOrEmpty())
    {
        return Json(new { Successful = false, ErrorMessage = "Id and Data must be supplied and cannot be empty." });
    }

    // Stream to an existing file (but delete file if it's at the beginning
    var path = "C:\\Temp\\" + fileId;

    // Stream to the file in append mode!
    using (var stream = new FileStream(path, FileMode.Append))
    {
        var bytes = Convert.FromBase64String(data);
        stream.Write(bytes, 0, bytes.Length);
    }

    return Json(new { Successful = true });
 }
```

To give a smooth progress, the calls have to be async which means that the order would be screwed up. To fix this, the
recursive method was used "uploadChunk" which gets invoked on each successful ajax callback and reports back to the
incoming callback method also that the chunk has completed.

This method also does the slicing up of the encoded data by keeping the current position, total individual file size
and requested chunk byte size. Once ready, the Ajax method prepares the full JSON object.

```javascript
var nextChunk = _chunkSize;

if (_sizeToUpload - _currentPosition < nextChunk) {
	nextChunk = _sizeToUpload - _currentPosition;
}

var dataToSend = data.slice(_currentPosition, _currentPosition + nextChunk);

$.ajax('http://someurlgoeshere.com', {
	type: 'POST',
	async: true,
	contentType: 'application/json;',
	dataType: 'json',
	data: JSON.stringify({ id: id, data: dataToSend, currentposition: _currentPosition })
});
```

Happy uploading! ðŸŽ‰
