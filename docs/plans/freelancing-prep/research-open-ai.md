Diversifying Your Tech Income: Freelancing and Side Work Options

Australia’s tech sector is booming, so taking on extra projects outside your day job is feasible. For example, Australia’s tech industry has grown 80% in five years and is now valued at A$167 billion, with software development leading at ~13% annual growth

. At the same time, freelancing is widespread: a recent report notes that “freelancers now make up more than a third of the [Australian] workforce” (plus ~746,000 people doing freelance on the side)

. Demand for web and software skills (especially cloud, AI, and cybersecurity) remains high

. In practice you can earn a good supplementary income – Aussie web developers typically charge on the order of A$70–150+ per hour (more with experience)

– so even small projects can be lucrative. In short, freelancing or part-time contracting can work well in Melbourne/Australia as long as you plan for the usual trade-offs (unpredictable hours and clients).

Finding Freelance and Part-Time Work

There are many ways to find gigs beyond your full-time job. Online marketplaces like Upwork, Freelancer.com or local tech platforms can connect you with remote clients globally (just be mindful of competition and platform fees). You can also use mainstream job sites: searches for “part-time software developer” or “contract software” show hundreds of opportunities. For example, Indeed currently lists 700+ part-time software engineer jobs in Australia
au.indeed.com
, while SEEK shows dozens of part-time roles and around 378 contract/temporary developer positions
seek.com.au
. These include remote-friendly gigs and short-term projects. Even without dedicated freelancing sites, many companies (startups, agencies, SMEs) advertise part-time or contract developer roles on Seek/Indeed, LinkedIn or industry forums.

In parallel, leverage your personal network: let colleagues, friends and local businesses know you’re available for projects. Melbourne has active tech and startup meetups (e.g. Melbourne Developer Meetup) where networking can yield leads. Reach out to digital agencies or consulting firms that hire contractors – for instance, Expert360 even notes that a large share of workers in Australia now freelance
expert360.com
. You can also partner with professionals in adjacent fields (designers, marketers) who might refer website projects to you. Don’t forget your own website: ensure it’s SEO-optimized with keywords like “Melbourne web developer” to appear in local searches.

Key ways to find work include:

Freelance platforms (Upwork, Freelancer, Gumtree, Airtasker, etc.).

Job boards (Indeed, SEEK, Jora, LinkedIn) with filters for part-time/contract.

Networking (tech meetups, LinkedIn outreach, local business groups).

Referrals and cold outreach (contact local businesses or agencies directly, share your portfolio).

Teaching or tutoring (short courses, mentoring bootcamps) – these pay modestly but can supplement income.

Always frame your offerings clearly (e.g. “I build business websites with WordPress/Next.js” or “small- to mid-size web apps”) and stress ethical sectors. You mentioned preferring no gambling – in practice, vet prospects and politely decline any work that doesn’t fit your values.

Assessing and Improving Your Portfolio Website

Your site already looks professional and up-to-date: it showcases your Staff Engineer role at Open Universities, lists relevant skills (React, TypeScript, Node, AWS, etc.) and features several projects (two local business sites and a personal notes app)

. This is great for demonstrating expertise. However, to attract paying clients you may want to tweak the focus. Freelancers often benefit from explicitly stating services offered and making contact easy. Portfolio guides recommend adding client testimonials or social proof and a prominent contact form or details, since the goal is to get more clients

. Your site currently has social links, but consider a clear “Contact Me” section (or even a simple form) so visitors don’t have to hunt for email/LinkedIn.

Likewise, highlight project outcomes for clients – e.g. “Built a Next.js/Sanity site for X company, improving their SEO and making content updates easy” – rather than only listing tech. If possible, ask those past clients (SES Melbourne, JLC Carpentry) for a short quote about working with you and include it. In short, follow portfolio best-practices: curate your best projects, note the value delivered, and make it simple for prospects to reach you
hostinger.com
. These tweaks can turn your strong developer-centric site into a more client-friendly showcase.

Other Tech Side-Gigs

Aside from pure web projects, there are related paths. For example, many companies offer ongoing part-time dev contracts (some as little as a few days per week) which provide regular pay. You could also consult on technology strategy, or freelance as a technical writer/blogger or course instructor (writing tutorials or doing workshops). If you have expertise in a niche (e.g. SEO for WordPress, Svelte components), consider building a small paid product or plugin – though this requires more upfront work. Even volunteering for open-source or small NGO tech projects can expand your network, potentially leading to paid gigs. Overall, staying within web development and related fields is wise, but you’re open to adjacent areas too (like mobile apps or DevOps) if demand is higher.

Administrative and Ethical Considerations

Make sure to set up properly: in Australia, freelancers/contractors are generally required to have an ABN (Australian Business Number) so you can invoice clients legally

. You should issue invoices and account for income; once annual income exceeds the GST threshold (~A$75K), you would need to register for GST. See Australian Tax Office guidance or resources (e.g. QuickBooks, Lawpath) for details. Also consider insurance (e.g. professional indemnity) if you take on significant projects. In terms of hours, manage your time to avoid burnout – perhaps limit freelancing to specific nights/weekends so it doesn’t conflict with your full-time role.

Finally, always choose work aligned with your ethics and skills. Focus on clients in fields you feel good about (for instance, education, health, retail, etc.) and decline anything questionable. A clear contract and scope will help avoid misunderstandings, and it’s fine to “fire” a client or step away if needed (many freelancers do this when engagements go awry
expert360.com
).

In summary: Freelancing or part-time tech work can be a rewarding supplement to your income, and Melbourne has plenty of opportunities. Your background and portfolio already show strong technical chops, but consider sharpening the site for client appeal (contact info, testimonials, service descriptions)
hostinger.com
. Combine that with active outreach – on platforms, networks and job boards – and you should be able to land projects that fit your schedule and ethical criteria. With moderate hours and good rates, even a few hours per week could noticeably boost your earnings without doubling your workload.
