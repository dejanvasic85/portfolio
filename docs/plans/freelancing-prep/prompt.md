Initial Prompt:
---
I would like to improve my portfolio website. My goal is to start doing some freelancing work from Melbourne Australia and I would like to make the website more appealing to potential clients. I have asked LLM's for some feedback on the current design and content. It can be found in the docs folder under plans/freelancing-prep.

From what I understand, we need to improve the projects page the most that would not be entirely focused on the technical details but more on the business metrics and testimonials first.

I have created a todo.md file to track the progress of this mini-project. I need help with the todos starting with the top one.

Let's try and move the existing content in to this projects.md file first to see what we can do to improve it first and the type of sections that we should have to improve the projects page. So essentially we want to improve the content model.

Then we'll tackle the other Todo's one by one.
