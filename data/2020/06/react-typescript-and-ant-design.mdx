Yet another React boilerplate (GitHub template) project!

Skip and show me the code: [https://github.com/dejanvasic85/react-ts-ant](https://github.com/dejanvasic85/react-ts-ant)

Purpose:

To have a "leaner" react solution ready to go when I'd like to build something from scratch. The amount of dependencies and tools that we require on the front-end these days is astonishing. If you like to calculate the permutations, be my guest but here are the choices I've made for starting a new Single Page Application in React:

*   Language: Typescript
*   Freshness: [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate)
*   CSS Modules with [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
*   Bundler: [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
*   Unit Testing: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) (no snapshots but thanks)
*   Build: Circle CI (coming soon)
*   Cypress end 2 end testing (coming soon)

After having a bad experience with some package dependencies, I came to the conclusion that I need to move away from Create React App. As a react newbie, I keep trying with CRA, but something always seems to be getting in the way.

### Ant Design and Theme

Ant Design is a pretty damn sweet React framework so this is something I wanted to start using. It's always the lazy option to use the basic theme so why not instead make use of the _[theming options](https://ant.design/docs/react/customize-theme)_ that are already available?

My goal is to have a single 
```
theme
```
.less file which overrides the default Ant variables. To achieve it, we'll have to do a bit of work by making use of webpack css loaders. Assuming you have knowledge of what they are!

When dissecting this file: https://github.com/dejanvasic85/react-ts-ant/blob/master/webpack/loaders.js

We can see the Ant Style loaders need to happen first.

```
 {
    test: /antd.*\.less$/,
    loader: isDevEnvironment ? ['style-loader', ...antStyleLoaders] : [MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, ...antStyleLoaders],
  },
  {
    test: /\.less?$/,
    exclude: excludedFolders,
    loader: isDevEnvironment ? ['style-loader', ...cssStyleLoaders] : [MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, ...cssStyleLoaders],
  },
```

The ant style loaders are defined here (cssLoaders.js):

```
variables
module.exports.antStyleLoaders = [
  {
    loader: 'css-loader',
  },
  postCssLoader,
  {
    loader: 'less-loader',
    options: {
      lessOptions: {
        javascriptEnabled: true,
        modifyVars,
      },
    },
  },
];
```

The 
```
javascriptEnabled
```
 must be true for . And notice the 
```
modifyVars
```
? That's where the magic happens for the theme to take effect.

Let's have a look at the declarations at the top of that file.

```
const fs = require('fs');
const lessToJs = require('less-vars-to-js');

const { localIdentName, rootPath } = require('./env');
const themeFile = fs.readFileSync(`${rootPath}/src/styles/theme.less`, 'utf-8');
const modifyVars = lessToJs(themeFile, { resolveVariables: true, stripPrefix: true });
```

There is a convenient package 
```
less-vars-to-js
```
 which allows us to use the 
```
theme.less
```
 (which is what I wanted) to declare all variables that will then be converted to a JSON object which in turn is used for the ant 'less-loader' in the previous code snippet.

At the moment 
```
theme.less
```
 file only contains a single variable to prove that it's working:

```
// Colour Palette
@primary-color: #4953fb;
```

This is converted to 
```
primaryColor
```
 when lessToJs does its work. There is however a huge amount of variables you can override from this [list found here](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less). And that's it! Now we can import styles and reference classes in our React components like this:

```
import styles from './App.less';

const { Header, Content } = Layout;

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Header className={styles.heading}>To Do</Header>
      <Content>
        <div className={styles.container}>
          <div className={styles.content}>
            <Typography.Title level={4}>What is on for today?</Typography.Title>
            <TodoList />
          </div>
        </div>
      </Content>
    </Layout>
  );
};
```

### Keeping everything up to date

Renovate is a tool I could not recommend enough to ensure that our dependencies are kept up to date with automatic Pull Requests. Given this is a small starter project, it can be used to test some of these major releases and breakages that may happen for other larger projects.

### Testing

Enzyme and Jest seem to be the natural choices for React these days but some examples can be a little tricky and hard to remember. This is why it's nice to have a full CRUD such as a To Do example in this solution. Saves me from hunting down some examples on using these tools.
