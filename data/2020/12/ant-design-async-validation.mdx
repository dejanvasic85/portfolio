Recently I came across the scenario where I needed to validate phone number or email are unique. So I had to use some server side validation on a form input.

There's a few ways that this can be solved.

Doing the validation in the API on form submit is definitely one of them. This logic should definitely remain server side in any case, since we don't want to completely rely on protecting our system only on our clients. I've even gone ahead and ensured that the Database Table has a unique only value for phone and email.

But how can we improve the user experience, so they don't have to wait to click a button and only then find out? Well, a nice way to do it is, is while the user typing or the input is validating.

[Ant Design](https://ant.design) docs could be a little friendlier, but I actually found the custom validator supports the async (or server side) validation out of the box. Check out this really simple PhoneInput component with Apollo GraphQL as a nice touch :)

```
import React from 'react';
import { useMutation } from '@apollo/client';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { Input, Form } from 'antd';
import { PhoneOutlined } from '@ant-design/icons';

interface Props {
  required?: boolean;
  validateUnique?: boolean;
}

interface ValidateResponse {
  validatePhone: boolean;
}

interface ValidateRequest {
  phoneNumber: string;
  ignoreMyPhone: boolean;
}

const VALIDATE\_PHONE = gql\`
  mutation VerifyPhone($phoneNumber: String!) {
    validatePhone(phoneNumber: $phoneNumber)
  }
\`;

const PhoneInput = ({ required = true, validateUnique = true }: Props) => {
  const \[validatePhone\] = useMutation<ValidateResponse, ValidateRequest>(VALIDATE\_PHONE);

  const pattern = /^!\*(\[0-9\]!\*){10,10}$/g;

  const handlePhoneValidation = async (\_, phoneNumber: string): Promise<boolean> => {
    const resp = await validatePhone({ variables: { phoneNumber, ignoreMyPhone } });

    if (!resp.data.validatePhone) {
      return Promise.reject(resp.data.validatePhone);
    }
    return Promise.resolve(true);
  };

  return (
    <Form.Item
      name="phone"
      label="Phone"
      validateFirst={true}
      validateTrigger="onBlur"
      rules={\[
        { required, message: 'Phone is required' },
        { pattern, message: 'Phone must be in the right format' },
        ...\[
          validateUnique
            ? { validator: handlePhoneValidation, message: \`This number is already associated to an account\` }
            : null,
        \],
      \]}
      hasFeedback
    >
      <Input prefix={<PhoneOutlined />} size="large" placeholder="04xxxxxxxx" />
    </Form.Item>
  );
};

export default PhoneInput;
```

Method 
```
handlePhoneValidation
```
 is invoked by the custom validator defined in the rules array of the field. It's as simple as declaring the method as async. We simple invoke the API method, and then we could either throw an error, or a rejected promise.

Another thing to note. The prop 
```
validateFirst
```
 is set to true. I don't really like this name, because it feels it needs explanation. Basically, it will only fire one validation at a time. In this instance, there is a pattern validator which is better to fire first before hitting our API. If something isn't working locally, it wouldn't make sense to load the server with an invalid field. Parallel validation sounds good, but not so much in this situation.

The prop 
```
validateTrigger
```
 being set to 
```
onBlur
```
, is another not-required property but in this instance I find useful because it will only fire when the focus leaves the element. The default Ant Design validation is on every keystroke.

How about the server side? The GraphQL resolver should be quite simple. Try and find a user by phone and return the appropriate response.

```
interface Args {
  phoneNumber: string;
  ignoreMyPhone: boolean;
}

const validatePhone = async (\_, args: Args, { dataSources, user }: ApiContext): Promise<boolean> => {
  const phoneNumber = userService.convertPhoneTo164(args.phoneNumber);
  if (!phoneNumber) {
    throw new UserInputError(Errors.INVALID\_PHONE);
  }


  const { userRepository } = dataSources;
  const anotherUser = await userRepository.findByPhone(phoneNumber);

  return !anotherUser;
};

export default validatePhone;

```

Happy validating!
