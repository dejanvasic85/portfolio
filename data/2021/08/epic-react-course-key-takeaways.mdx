About a month ago I've started to slowly chip away at [Kent C Dodds Epic React course](https://epicreact.dev/learn), that was gratefully funded by Open Universities.

Although I've been building apps for production in React for a few years, I never really felt confident that I understood all the optimisations and craved to learn some useful patterns.

It was my intention to document some of the learnings here, so that I can refer back to them (if any), and after doing a few modules I'm greatly to share some things. Some of them may be broken up in different posts to prevent an overly large post.

## Calling useState with a function for Lazy Loading

After visiting the React documentation, it was confirmed that this was not mentioned anywhere. Not sure why but it could be pretty useful, in particular to a situation outlined below. Every time we invoke useState, we can supply a function instead of a value. This function is the lazy initialiser and can be used for situations where setting initial state is a little more expensive than just setting a hardcoded value. One example used in the course was reading from local storage and deserializing an object for a nifty little **useLocalStorage** hook:

```
function useLocalStorage(
  key,
  defaultValue = '',
  {serialize = JSON.stringify, deserialize = JSON.parse} = {},
) {
  // check out the function that we pass in to useState!
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(() => {
    const localStorageValue = window.localStorage.getItem(key)
    if (localStorageValue) {
      return deserialize(localStorageValue)
    }

    return typeof defaultValue === 'function' ? defaultValue() : defaultValue
  })

  const prevKeyRef = React.useRef(key)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const prevKey = prevKeyRef.current
    if (prevKey !== key) {
      window.localStorage.removeItem(prevKey)
    }

    prevKeyRef.current = key
    window.localStorage.setItem(key, serialize(value))
  }, [key, value, serialize])

  return [value, setValue]
}
```
