Have you needed to reuse some code for Next pages in particular within the server side function 
```
getServerSideProps
```
 when preparing the props for a page?

Some common and practical examples include fetching a user and authorising them. But for simplicity sake, we'll use logging latency. Here we have a simple page that requires Props to be created based on an Api call. We want to capture the latency by capturing the current timestamp, execute code for assembling the props and then log the latency at the end.

```
import axios from 'axios';
import logger from './logger';

interface PageProps {
  hello: string;
}

export default function MyPage<PageProps>({hello}) {
  return <h1>{hello}</h1>
}

export const getServerSideProps = async (ctx: GetServerSidePropsContext): Promise<GetServerSidePropsResult<P>> => {
  const startTime = Date.now();

  const apiResult = await axios.fetch('/api/hello');

  const finish = Date.now() - start;
  logger.info({ message: 'httpLog', latencyMs: finish });

  return {
    props: {
      hello: apiResult.data,
    }
  }
}
```

We may want to repeat our logging code in other pages. Copy pasting it would be breaking our DRY principles and that would make a lot of people sad.

Instead we can wrap our function in a High Order Function. In React this concept is very similar to HOC's and in Express think of this as middleware.

For good measure, here's an example with Typescript!

```
import { GetServerSideProps, GetServerSidePropsContext, GetServerSidePropsResult } from 'next';

import logger from './logger';

export const withLogging = <P extends { [key: string]: any } = { [key: string]: any }>(gssp: GetServerSideProps<P>) => {
  return async (ctx: GetServerSidePropsContext): Promise<GetServerSidePropsResult<P>> => {
    const startTime = Date.now();
    const result = await gssp(ctx);
    const latency = Date.now() - startTime;

    logger.info({
      latency,
      msg: 'HttpLog',
      url: ctx.resolvedUrl,
    });

    return result;
  };
};
```

So our re-written page function would look like:

```
export const getServerSideProps = withLogging(async (ctx: GetServerSidePropsContext): Promise<GetServerSidePropsResult<P>> => {

  const apiResult = await axios.fetch('/api/hello');

  return {
    props: {
      hello: apiResult.data,
    }
  }
})
```

Auth0 NextJS library uses a similar concept but much harder to read/understand code. https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0/blob/main/src/helpers/with-page-auth-required.ts#L98

So this was my attempt to simplify it for others and provide a working example.

Happy coding
