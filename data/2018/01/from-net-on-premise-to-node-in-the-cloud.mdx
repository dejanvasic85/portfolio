As a very long time .Net (mainly web) developer my main tooling consisted of ASP.Net MVC built using Visual Studio and a backend most likely a SQL server database. The front-end didn't matter so much as it was just served by IIS that was using the .Net Framework. So what made me make take the plunge in to the JavaScript world and in to cloud provider hosting which are now part of my everyday job at MYOB? Quite simply, cloud hosting is trending for the bigger companies as it reduces costs greatly and it provides so much versatility and flexibility for different architectures. But why JavaScript and Node? I guess, Microsoft took the hit with DotNetCore and it's ability to run on the cheap Linux boxes which is still pre-mature in many respects. So my team selecting Node in mid-2016 before my arrival was an obvious choice. My way of catching up and learning the best is to learn by doing my own side-project which I would build, test and deploy from scratch. In my previous world I manage to achieve the following steps using TeamCity and Octopus Deploy:

1.  Build
2.  Unit Test
3.  Package Artifacts
4.  Deploy to CI Environment
5.  Run Automation Tests
6.  Deploy To Test Environment
7.  Deploy To Production Environment

Steps 6 and 7 were manual but could easily have been automatic triggers. The deployment steps also have ability to deploy a multi-tenanted application. Steps 1 to 5 are performed on EVERY single branch. This is something that I slightly found to be a pain in the cloud hosting environment. The cost saving part in the cloud definitely surrounds the production environment. However, to replicate all of this in different environments such as Dev, Test, Perf etc, I found that the cost could start rising quickly especially when automation and performance testing come in to play. That's why, one lesson learned recently is to practice destroying environments as soon as you are finished or at least on a nightly basis. In other words, treating environments as sheep. Using IIS and SQL on a Windows Box single seemed much easier to setup and perform automation and integration testing. This saved my buttocks on many occasions and something we must do before deploying to production! So it will be very interesting to see how this goes for my new adventure. As you can see, I am a true believer that continuous integration and delivery should be part of our developer DNA. In the next few months, my goal is to build a very small (let's call it a microservice) node application that can mimic the best practice development process all the way to production. And hopefully I can blog about each experience, particularly the ones I find painful. The tools I will be using will be:

*   Terraform
*   AWS
*   Docker
*   Node Api using Express
*   Database (most likely dynamo but still deciding)

My reasoning for most of the choices is simply to stay closer to my stack at my primary job so that I can grow to master some of them one day.
