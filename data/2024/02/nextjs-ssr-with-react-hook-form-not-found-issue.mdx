Recently, our Next.js application started reporting that a handful of users were experiencing a 'Not Found' error after submitting a form. Upon reviewing session replays, it became clear that users were encountering a 404 error immediately after form submission, despite the page and form being fully rendered.

## The problem

In our setup, we utilized 
```
[react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
```
 within a client-side component to manage form submissions, which would then fetch data to the server. The form resided on the 
```
/citizenship
```
 page, with data submissions directed to 
```
/api/citizenship
```
. However, an issue arose when the JavaScript handler for the form submission hadn't yet loaded, leading users to unintentionally trigger a default GET request to a non-existent endpoint.

## The root cause

When a user initially loads the HTML page, the form is visible, but the JavaScript 
```
onSubmit
```
 handler is absent until the Next.js page chunk fully loads. If a user submits the form before the handler is ready, the form defaults to a GET action, appending the selected value as a URL parameter (e.g., 
```
/citizenship?australianCitizen=yes
```
), leading to a 404 since that endpoint does not exist.

## **Solution 1: Disabling the Submit Button**

To address this, we decided to prevent form submission until the JavaScript was fully loaded. This was achieved by disabling the submit button initially and then enabling it via 
```
useEffect
```
, ensuring synchronicity between the handler's readiness and the button's activation.

```
'use client';  
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';  
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';  
  
export const CitizenForm = () => {  
  const [isEnabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);  
  const form = useForm();  
  
  useEffect(() => {  
    setEnabled(true);  
  }, []);  
  
  const onSubmit = (data) => {  
    fetch('/api/citizenship', {  
      method: 'POST',  
      body: JSON.stringify(data),  
    });  
  };  
  
  return (  
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>  
      ...  
      <button type="submit" disabled={!isEnabled}>Submit</button>  
    </form>  
  );  
};
```

## **Solution 2: Leveraging Server Actions**

Another potential solution, which I hadn't explored at the time, involves utilizing server actions in Next.js. This approach allows for form submissions without relying on client-side JavaScript, offering a more streamlined and elegant solution.

## Conclusion

Addressing the 'Form Not Found' issue in Next.js applications can be challenging but is crucial for maintaining a seamless user experience. By either disabling the submit button until the JavaScript loads or utilizing server actions, developers can ensure reliable form submissions in their applications.
