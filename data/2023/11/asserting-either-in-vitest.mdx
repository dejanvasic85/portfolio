Discovering the potential of the FP-TS library has been a rewarding experience, unlocking the power of functional programming. However, integrating it seamlessly can pose challenges. In my recent exploration of extending vitest matchers for the FP-TS 'Either' object, I encountered obstacles—particularly TypeScript's reluctance to recognize custom matchers.

This post aims to share insights gained from overcoming these challenges, providing a guide for those grappling with TypeScript's nuances or seeking to enhance their testing suite for FP-TS. Let's dive in:

Ok. Let's start with a super simple function that returns Either right when a number is positive or a Left with a message when the number is negative:

```
const isPositive = (n: number): E.Either<string, number> => {  
	return n >= 0 ? E.right(n) : E.left('Negative number');  
};
```

How could we write a test for it?

```
import * as E from 'fp-ts/Either';  
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';  
  
const isPositive = (n: number): E.Either<string, number> => {  
	return n >= 0 ? E.right(n) : E.left('Negative number');  
};  
  
describe('Either', () => {  
	it('isPositive', () => {  
		const result = isPositive(1);  
		expect(E.isRight(result)).toBe(true);  
	});  
});  

```

Using the 
```
isRight
```
 or 
```
isLeft
```
 utility from Either is great to assert the result type but what about the actual value (right or left object value)?

Given the **[Either](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Either.ts.html)** is a union type in Typescript the only way to gain access to the Right or Left object without errors is by checkin the tag first:

```
	it('isPositive', () => {  
		const result = isPositive(1);  
		expect(E.isRight(result)).toBe(true);  
		if (E.isRight(result)) {  
			expect(result.right).toBe(1);  
		}  
	});
```

Having if statements in test code doesn't feel very clean!

Wouldn't it be nice if we could do both at once like this for left or right by calling a method like 
```
toBeRightStrictEqual
```
 which with is akin to the 
```
toStrictEquals
```
?

```
	it('isPositive', () => {  
		const result = isPositive(1);  
		expect(result).toBeRightStrictEqual(1);  
	});  
  
	it('isNegative', () => {  
		const result = isPositive(-1);  
		expect(result).toBeLeftStrictEqual('Negative number');  
	});
```

Easy. Vitest has it covered with [custom matchers.](https://vitest.dev/guide/extending-matchers) First we'll need the setup file for vitest config that has the actual matchers:

```
import * as E from 'fp-ts/Either';  
import * as vitest from 'vitest';  
  
declare module 'vitest' {  
	interface CustomMatchers<R = unknown> {  
		toBeRightStrictEqual(expected: any): R;  
	}  
}  
  
vitest.expect.extend({  
	toBeRightStrictEqual(received: E.Either<unknown, unknown>, expected: unknown) {  
		return {  
			pass: E.isRight(received) && this.equals(received.right, expected),  
			message: () => `expected ${received} to be right ${expected}`  
		};  
	},  
	toBeLeftStrictEqual(received, expected) {  
		return {  
			pass: E.isLeft(received) && this.equals(received.left, expected),  
			message: () => `expected ${received} to be left ${expected}`  
		};  
	}  
});  

```

Finally. We then need the the declarations file for Typescript. This file should be able to live anywhere in your src directory. I named it 
```
vitest.extend.d.ts
```
. The contents:

```
interface CustomMatchers<R = unknown> {  
	toBeRightStrictEqual(data: unknown): R;  
	toBeLeftStrictEqual(data: unknown): R;  
}  
  
declare module 'vitest' {  
	interface Assertion<T = any> extends CustomMatchers<T> {}  
	interface AsymmetricMatchersContaining extends CustomMatchers {}  
}  
  
export {};  

```

Hope this helps others keep their code clean with some nicer Either assertions in Typescript!
