## Why I Built This

This site is my digital home to share my professional journey, projects, and technical insights. It serves as a living CV, a blog for my thoughts on software engineering, and a showcase for selected work. Building it with Astro allowed me to explore modern static site generation and best practices for performance and maintainability.

## Developing and Running Locally

To run the site locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Preview the site**:

   - Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) in your browser.

4. **Format code** (optional):

   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```

## Deploying

The site is deployed on Vercel. To deploy your own version, connect the repository to Vercel and set up the project. No special environment variables are required for a basic portfolio/blog.
